        Born Benard William Honeycomb Bear in an unkwown year. 
        Bernie is the youngest of Barry & Mary. Bernie
        has an older brother and sister; Ben and Maggie. 
        Bernie was born and grew up in the woodlands, until
        one day Bernie; the youngest of the siblings, grew
        tired of being one with nature, living life in the 
        woodlands. He decided to use his appreciation for tea
        to travel the world and learn all there was to know about
        tea.

        That's when Bernie decided to set off to the outer
        world to learn and discover more of the beauty
        that is tea. He would return 3 years later, now to-"tea"-lly
        filled with more tea knowlegde and experience than ever.
    </p>
    <p>Bernie is now based in London and lives with his 2 flatmates
       Emma and Jack. When not working at the tea shop, i.e. everyday
       of the week except Tuesdays and Wednesdays. During his free
       time, he likes to go to the Google search engine in the middle of
       the night and search for such examples "Chicken Rotiseries near me", 
       "How to wash face properly" and "How much water is in a watermelon? ".
